On this website, I aim to catalog both the projects I've completed and those I plan to tackle in the future. This website not only serves as a record of these projects but also as a visual index of my progress. From crafting a Minecraft calculator in middle school to designing a complete flight computer PCB from scratch, there's value in reflecting on our progress and appreciating how far we've come.

The two images above showcase Minecraft Redstone calculators, both designed by me. For those who aren't familiar, Redstone is an element in the video game Minecraft that allows users to create logic gates, which in turn can be used to construct calculators and computers. One of these calculators was built by 11-year-old me, while the other was the work of 17-year-old me. Can you distinguish between the two? Unsurprisingly, the more complex calculator at the bottom of the picture is the creation of my 17-year-old self, whereas the top one was assembled when I was only 11.

I bring this up to underscore a fundamental truth about learning and personal development. Whether we're creating Redstone calculators or learning to code, progress often feels elusive on a day-to-day scale.

> You often don't realize how far you've come until you look back at where you started

This encapsulates the purpose of my website – to provide a platform where I can look back to appreciate the journey, as well as project what lies ahead.
