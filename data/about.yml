description:
  My name is David Reynolds, I am an Aerospace Engineering Major at Georgia Tech with a
  projected graduation date of Fall of 2025. I have a passion for aviation, and for
  that matter, anything that flies. I acquired my private pilot's license when I was
  17 and my instrument rating a year later while in high school. Furthermore, I built
  rockets and earned a NAR level one rocketry certification and at that same time
  built and launched high-altitude balloons that reached the stratosphere. After
  entering college I started to experiment with avionics and PCB design.
