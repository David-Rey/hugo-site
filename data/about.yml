  Hello, I'm David Reynolds, an Aerospace Engineering Major at Georgia Tech, set to graduate in the Fall of 2025. My head has always been in the clouds, not because I'm a daydreamer, but due to my fervent passion for all things aviation.


  The spark was ignited when I earned my private pilot's license at the young age of 17. I then soared through my instrument rating just a year later all this while juggling the demands of high school. In between textbooks and extracurriculars, I developed an affinity for rockets, building them from scratch. Eventually, I achieved a National Association of Rocketry (NAR) Level One Rocketry Certification and launched high-altitude balloons that grazed the edge of the stratosphere.


  After entering college I started to experiment with avionics and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design and would soon work on a flight computer for the Rocket Club. The invaluable experience I gained from this club led to my creation of the Ares Flight Computer - an all-in-one flight computer designed for model rocket navigation guidance and control. During this time, I also developed a ballistic trajectory calculator in MATLAB, a high-level programming language.


  The central theme of my journey so far is my relentless pursuit of knowledge. No matter what I am always pushing the limits of what I know. My mission is to evolve into the best version of myself, both academically and personally. There's always a new frontier to explore, a new challenge to tackle, and I'm geared up for the ride. So join me, as I embark on this lifelong quest of discovery and innovation - the sky is no longer the limit, it's just the beginning.
